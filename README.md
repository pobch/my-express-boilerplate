- Add eslint + prettier which are used in **Node with React: Fullstack Web Development** on server-side. Then I use
```
    "extends": ["plugin:prettier/recommended"]
```
instead of
```
    "plugins": ["prettier"],
    "rules": {
      "prettier/prettier": "error"
    }
```
for this boilerplate because of the prettier's doc suggestion.
- Add folder structure
